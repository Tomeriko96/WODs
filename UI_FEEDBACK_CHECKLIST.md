# WOD Browser App UI/UX Feedback Checklist

## Visual Hierarchy & Readability
- [x] Header and section separation with bold backgrounds/colored bands
- [x] Larger and bolder font for main headings and workout names

## Filters & Sidebar
- [ ] Condense filters with card grouping or collapsible panels
- [x] Highlight active filters as colored chips/badges
- [x] More prominent "Clear All Filters" button with icon

## Workout Cards
 [x] Consistent card layout with background color, shadow, and padding
 [x] Use icons/emojis for metadata (category, equipment, time cap, scaling)

## Button Styles & Calls to Action
