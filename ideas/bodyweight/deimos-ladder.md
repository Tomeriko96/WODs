# Deimos Ladder

**Equipment:** Pull-up bar, none
**Time Cap:** 25-35 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce top set number, use assisted pull-ups, substitute inverted rows

**Workout:**
- Start at 1 chin-up and add 1 rep each set until you hit your max
- Work your way back down to 1 rep
- After each set of chins: 5 push-ups and 5 bodyweight squats
- Repeat the entire sequence with dips (matching your chin-up top set)
- After each set of dips: 5 inverted rows and 5 bodyweight squats

**Notes:**
Start with whichever movement you're weaker in. Example: If your top set is 7 reps, you'll do 49 chins/dips, 65 push-ups/rows, and 130 squats total.
