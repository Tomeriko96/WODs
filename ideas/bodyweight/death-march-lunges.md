# Death March Lunges

**Equipment:** None
**Time Cap:** 12 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce walking distance or do stationary lunges

**Workout:**
- 100 walking lunges (50 each leg)
- Every 10 lunges, stop and do 5 burpees
- Continue until all 100 lunges are complete

**Notes:**
Inspired by military march concepts. Focus on deep lunge range of motion. The burpee breaks make this deceptively challenging.
