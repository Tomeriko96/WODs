# Countdown Carnage

**Equipment:** None
**Time Cap:** 12 minutes
**Scaling:** Start from 15 instead of 20, or modify burpees to squat thrusts

**Workout:**
- 20 burpees
- 19 jump squats
- 18 push-ups
- 17 mountain climbers (each leg)
- Continue counting down by 1 until you reach 1 of each movement

**Notes:**
Inspired by countdown protocols. Starts brutal and gets easier. The mental challenge is pushing through the high-rep rounds.
