# Juarez Valley Challenge

**Equipment:** None
**Time Cap:** 20-30 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce top set, substitute easier movements, add rest periods

**Workout:**
- Hit a max rep set of burpees, then use Juarez Valley pattern
- Instead of working down linearly, bounce between high and low reps
- Between each set: bear crawl 10 steps forward and back
- Example with 8 rep max: 8 burpees → 1 burpee → 7 burpees → 2 burpees → 6 burpees → 3 burpees → 5 burpees → 4 burpees
- Bear crawl between every set

**Notes:**
Named after the prison workout pattern. Start conservatively with your max rep set. The bear crawls provide "rest" while keeping you moving.
