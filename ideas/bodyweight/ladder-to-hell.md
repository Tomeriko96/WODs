# Ladder to Hell

**Equipment:** None
**Time Cap:** 18 minutes
**Scaling:** Start at rep 5 instead of 10, or use easier movement variations

**Workout:**
- Start at 10 reps each: burpees, push-ups, air squats
- Each round, reduce by 1 rep
- When you reach 1 rep, immediately start climbing back up to 10
- No rest between rounds

**Notes:**
The "hell" part kicks in during the climb back up. Mental toughness is as important as physical conditioning here.
