# Unearth Ladder

**Equipment:** None
**Time Cap:** 15-20 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce ladder height, substitute regular squats for jump squats, use knee push-ups

**Workout:**
- Start at 1 rep and climb to 10, then back down to 1
- Each rung: burpees, jump squats, push-ups
- Example: 1 burpee, 1 jump squat, 1 push-up, then 2 of each, etc.
- Work up to 10 reps, then back down: 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

**Notes:**
Adapted from the Unearth protocol. Total volume: 100 burpees, 100 jump squats, 100 push-ups. The up-and-down ladder pattern creates a natural warm-up and cool-down.
