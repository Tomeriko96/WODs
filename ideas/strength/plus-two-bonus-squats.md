# Plus Two Bonus Squats

**Equipment:** Barbell, squat rack, plates
**Time Cap:** 25-30 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce weight, scale bonus reps, use goblet squats

**Workout:**
- Back squat working sets with "+2 bonus" protocol:
  - Set 1: 5 reps at working weight + 2 bonus reps
  - Set 2: 5 reps (add weight) + 2 bonus reps
  - Set 3: 5 reps (add weight) + 2 bonus reps
  - Set 4: 5 reps (add weight) + 2 bonus reps  
  - Set 5: 5 reps + AMRAP bonus (goal: more than 2)
- 3-4 minutes rest between sets

**Notes:**
Based on Mythical Strength's "+2 Bonus" concept. The extra reps push beyond planned volume. Choose starting weight conservatively to allow progression. Mental challenge comes from the "bonus" work.
