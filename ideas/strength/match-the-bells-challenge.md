# Match the Bells Challenge

**Equipment:** Barbell, pair of kettlebells
**Time Cap:** 15 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce starting weight, use lighter kettlebells, reduce reps

**Workout:**
- Load barbell with 2 plates per side and matching weight kettlebells
- 20 back squats, then 10 KB thrusters (squat to press)
- Remove half a plate (20kg/45lbs total) and repeat
- Continue until barbell weight matches or is less than total KB weight
- Example: 100kg → KB thrusters → 80kg → KB thrusters → 60kg → KB thrusters → 40kg → KB thrusters

**Notes:**
Time challenge - aim to beat previous times. The final squat set can be done for 40 reps if desired. Kettlebell weight should be about half your starting barbell weight.
