# Deadlift Bar Grip Builder

**Equipment:** Barbell, plates
**Time Cap:** 20-25 minutes
**Scaling:** Use straps as backup, reduce weight, fewer holds

**Workout:**
- 5 working sets of deadlifts with grip focus:
  - Set 1: 5 reps + 10-second hold at top of last rep
  - Set 2: 5 reps + 15-second hold (add weight)
  - Set 3: 5 reps + 20-second hold (add weight)
  - Set 4: 5 reps + 30-second hold (same weight as Set 3)
  - Set 5: AMRAP + max hold (Set 2 weight)
- 3-4 minutes rest between sets

**Notes:**
Based on Mythical Strength's deadlift/bar grip builder. The holds build grip endurance and mental toughness. No straps until grip fails. Choose weights that challenge both lift and hold.
