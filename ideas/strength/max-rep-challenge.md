# Max Rep Challenge

**Equipment:** Barbell
**Time Cap:** 30 minutes
**Scaling:** Use appropriate weight for fitness level

**Workout:**
Choose one exercise (bench, squat, or deadlift):
- Work up to challenging weight (85-90% effort)
- Perform max reps at that weight
- Goal: beat your previous max rep record

**Notes:**
Pure strength endurance test. Choose weight wisely - too heavy and you'll get 1-2 reps, too light defeats the purpose.
