# Shrugs Against Bands

**Equipment:** Barbell, plates, resistance bands
**Time Cap:** 15-20 minutes
**Scaling:** Use lighter weight, remove bands, scale reps

**Workout:**
- Set up barbell for shrugs with resistance bands attached (adding tension at top)
- 5 working sets:
  - Set 1: 15 reps at moderate weight
  - Set 2: 12 reps (add weight)
  - Set 3: 10 reps (add weight) 
  - Set 4: 8 reps (add weight)
  - Set 5: AMRAP at Set 3 weight
- 2-3 minutes rest between sets

**Notes:**
Based on Mythical Strength's band-resisted shrug concept. Bands create accommodating resistance, hardest at top where traps are strongest. Focus on holding peak contraction.
