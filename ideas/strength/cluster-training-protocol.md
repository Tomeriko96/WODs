# Cluster Training Protocol

**Equipment:** Barbell
**Time Cap:** 25 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce weight or cluster size

**Workout:**
Bench press clusters:
- 5 sets of 3.2.1 (3 reps, 20 seconds rest, 2 reps, 20 seconds rest, 1 rep)
- Rest 3 minutes between clusters
- Use 85-90% of 5RM weight

**Notes:**
Cluster training for strength-power. Short rests maintain strength while accumulating volume. Focus on bar speed.
