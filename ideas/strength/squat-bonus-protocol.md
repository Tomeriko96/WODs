# Squat Bonus Protocol

**Equipment:** Barbell
**Time Cap:** 15 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce weight or total reps

**Workout:**
Work to daily max squat, then:
- Every rep after your max earns a +2 bonus
- Goal: earn 50 bonus points
- Must use 80% of max weight for bonus reps

**Notes:**
Mythical's +2 bonus concept. Psychological trick to push beyond your "max". The bonus points make extra reps feel rewarding.
