# Grip Strength Deadlift Test

**Equipment:** Barbell with moderate weight
**Time Cap:** 20 minutes
**Scaling:** Use lighter weight or straps if needed

**Workout:**
5 rounds:
- 8 deadlifts (no straps)
- Hold last rep for max time
- When grip fails, immediately do farmer's walk to failure
- Rest 3 minutes between rounds

**Notes:**
Grip strength and deadlift volume combined. When your grip goes, you're done with that round. Mental toughness required.
