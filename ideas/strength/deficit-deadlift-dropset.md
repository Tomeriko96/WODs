# Deficit Deadlift Dropset

**Equipment:** Barbell, plates, platform/blocks for deficit
**Time Cap:** 20-25 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce starting weight, smaller deficits, fewer drops

**Workout:**
- Start with heavy deficit deadlift (2-4 inch deficit)
- 5 reps at 85% 1RM
- Remove deficit, same weight: 5 reps
- Drop 20% weight: 8 reps  
- Drop another 20%: 12 reps
- Drop another 20%: 15 reps
- Rest 5 minutes and repeat for 2-3 total rounds

**Notes:**
Based on Mythical Strength's Deficit Deadlift ROM Dropset. The deficit increases difficulty at start, then ROM and load changes create unique stimulus. Focus on form maintenance throughout.
