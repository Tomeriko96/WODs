# Deficit Deadlift Builder

**Equipment:** Barbell, 2-4 inch platform
**Time Cap:** 20 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce deficit or use lighter weight

**Workout:**
Deficit deadlifts:
- 5 sets of 4 reps
- Stand on 2-3 inch platform
- Use 90-95% of floor deadlift max
- Rest 3 minutes between sets

**Notes:**
Increased range of motion builds strength off the floor. Harder starting position improves regular deadlift lockout.
