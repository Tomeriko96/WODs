# Deficit Deadlift Strip Set

**Equipment:** Barbell, plates, 2-inch deficit
**Time Cap:** 15 minutes
**Scaling:** Start with lighter weight or reduce deficit

**Workout:**
- Max reps deficit deadlifts at working weight
- Strip 20lbs, max reps floor deadlifts
- Strip 20lbs, max reps again
- Continue until empty barbell

**Notes:**
ROM dropset protocol. Start with deficit (hardest), progress to easier positions as weight decreases. Pure volume torture.
