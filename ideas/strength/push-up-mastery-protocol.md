# Push-Up Mastery Protocol

**Equipment:** None
**Time Cap:** 25 minutes
**Scaling:** Use knee push-ups or incline variations

**Workout:**
Goal: 400 push-ups total
- Start with max set
- Rest equal to work time
- Continue until 400 total
- Track number of sets needed

**Notes:**
Mythical's 400 push-up challenge. Mental game as much as physical. The rest periods get longer as sets get smaller.
