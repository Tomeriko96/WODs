# Banded Shrug Protocol

**Equipment:** Resistance bands or barbell
**Time Cap:** 12 minutes
**Scaling:** Use lighter resistance or reduce rep count

**Workout:**
4 sets:
- 20 shrugs with 3-second holds at top
- 15 shrugs with explosive concentric
- 10 shrugs with 5-second negatives
- Rest 2 minutes between sets

**Notes:**
Band resistance creates variable load throughout range of motion. Focus on trap activation and controlled movement patterns.
