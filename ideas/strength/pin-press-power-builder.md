# Pin Press Power Builder

**Equipment:** Barbell, squat rack with pins
**Time Cap:** 20 minutes
**Scaling:** Adjust pin height or reduce weight

**Workout:**
Pin press from chest level:
- 5 sets of 3 reps
- Start from dead stop on pins
- Use 110-120% of regular bench max
- Rest 3 minutes between sets

**Notes:**
Partial range press for lockout strength. Starting from dead stop eliminates stretch reflex. Build pure pressing power.
