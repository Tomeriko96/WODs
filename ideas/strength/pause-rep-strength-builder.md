# Pause Rep Strength Builder

**Equipment:** Barbell
**Time Cap:** 20 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce pause time or weight

**Workout:**
Squat pause reps:
- 5 sets of 5 reps
- 3-second pause at bottom of each rep
- Use 75-80% of regular squat max
- Rest 3 minutes between sets

**Notes:**
Pause reps eliminate bounce and build strength out of the hole. Teaches patience and control under load.
