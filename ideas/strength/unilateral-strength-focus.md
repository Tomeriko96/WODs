# Unilateral Strength Focus

**Equipment:** Dumbbells, kettlebells
**Time Cap:** 22 minutes
**Scaling:** Use lighter weights, reduce complexity

**Workout:**
Single-sided strength:
- 4 rounds of:
  - 6 single-arm presses (each arm)
  - 8 single-leg deadlifts (each leg)
  - 10 Bulgarian split squats (each leg)
  - 12 single-arm rows (each arm)

**Notes:** Eliminate imbalances! Unilateral training reveals and fixes weak sides. Train one side at a time for maximum effect!
