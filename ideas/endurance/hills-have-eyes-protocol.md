# Hills Have Eyes Protocol

**Equipment:** Hill or treadmill, timer
**Time Cap:** 25-30 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce hill grade, shorter intervals, walk recovery

**Workout:**
- 5 x 2-minute hill sprints at 80-85% effort
- Recovery: 2-minute easy jog/walk down hill
- After each sprint interval: 20 bodyweight squats at bottom of hill
- Finish with 5-minute easy pace run

**Notes:**
Inspired by Mythical Strength's "Hills Have Eyes" protocol. The bodyweight squats add strength endurance component. Can be done on treadmill with incline. Focus on consistent effort rather than speed.
