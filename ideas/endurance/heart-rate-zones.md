# Heart Rate Zones

**Equipment:** Heart rate monitor (optional)
**Time Cap:** 45 minutes
**Scaling:** Adjust zone percentages based on fitness level

**Workout:**
- 5 minutes Zone 1 (easy)
- 10 minutes Zone 2 (aerobic base)
- 5 minutes Zone 3 (tempo)
- 3 minutes Zone 4 (threshold)
- 2 minutes Zone 1 recovery
- Repeat 2x, then 10 minute Zone 1 cool-down

**Notes:**
If no HR monitor, use perceived exertion. Zone 1 = very easy, Zone 4 = hard but sustainable.
