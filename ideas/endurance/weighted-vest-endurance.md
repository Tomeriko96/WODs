# Weighted Vest Endurance

**Equipment:** Weighted vest (10-20lbs), running space, timer
**Time Cap:** 20-25 minutes
**Scaling:** Use lighter vest or no vest, shorter duration

**Workout:**
- 15-minute continuous run wearing weighted vest
- Pace: Conversational effort (should be able to speak in short sentences)
- Every 3 minutes: 10 push-ups (vest still on)
- Cool down: 5-minute walk without vest

**Notes:**
Inspired by weighted conditioning protocols. The vest adds load without changing movement pattern. Push-ups with vest provide strength endurance component. Total: 50 push-ups. Start with lighter vest and progress weekly.
