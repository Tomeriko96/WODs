# Fun Run Standard Issue

**Equipment:** None
**Time Cap:** 45 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce total distance or adjust pace

**Workout:**
- 5-minute easy warm-up run
- 30 minutes at moderate intensity (slightly uncomfortable but sustainable)
- Include 3-4 hills if available
- 10-minute easy cool-down

**Notes:**
TB protocol fun run. More challenging than LSS but not all-out. Should feel like you worked but could repeat tomorrow.
