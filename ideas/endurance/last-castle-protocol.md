# Last Castle Protocol

**Equipment:** Running space, timer
**Time Cap:** 25-30 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce total intervals, decrease sprint duration

**Workout:**
- 8 x 3-minute intervals alternating:
  - Odd intervals (1, 3, 5, 7): Steady run at 75% effort
  - Even intervals (2, 4, 6, 8): 30 seconds hard sprint + 2:30 recovery jog
- 1-minute walking rest between all intervals

**Notes:**
Based on "The Last Castle" concept. Creates a castle wall pattern with alternating steady and interval efforts. The final sprint interval should feel like defending the last castle. Focus on maintaining form during fatigue.
