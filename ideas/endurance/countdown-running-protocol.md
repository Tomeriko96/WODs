# Countdown Running Protocol

**Equipment:** Running space, timer
**Time Cap:** 20-22 minutes
**Scaling:** Start with shorter countdown, reduce intensity

**Workout:**
- Run for 10 minutes at steady pace
- Then countdown: 9 minutes, 8 minutes, 7 minutes, 6 minutes, 5 minutes
- Rest 1 minute between each interval
- Each interval at progressively faster pace (10-min easiest, 5-min hardest)

**Notes:**
Based on Mythical Strength's Countdown protocol. The descending time with increasing intensity creates a unique challenge. Paces should feel: 10-min (conversational), 9-8 min (comfortable), 7-6 min (moderate), 5-min (hard).
