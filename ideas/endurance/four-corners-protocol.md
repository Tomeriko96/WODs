# Four Corners Protocol

**Equipment:** Treadmill or running route, pull-up bar, dip station
**Time Cap:** 24-40 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce rounds, walk instead of run, modify circuit reps

**Workout:**
- Circuit training with timed intervals
- Get on treadmill/start run route
- Every 4 minutes, stop and do:
  - 4 overhead presses
  - 4 chin-ups  
  - 4 dips
  - 4 push-ups
- Return to running immediately
- Continue for 6-10 total circuits (24-40 minutes)

**Notes:**
Inspired by tactical training protocols. Use first 4 minutes as warm-up walk. Can use weight vest for added difficulty. Requires access to equipment near running area or plan route accordingly.
