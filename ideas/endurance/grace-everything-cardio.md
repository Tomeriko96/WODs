# Grace Everything Cardio

**Equipment:** Running space, timer
**Time Cap:** 15-20 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce rounds, use shorter intervals

**Workout:**
- 5 rounds for time:
- 400m run (moderate effort)
- 200m run (hard effort) 
- 100m sprint (maximum effort)
- 1-minute walking recovery between rounds
- Goal: Consistent pacing across all rounds

**Notes:**
Inspired by Mythical Strength's "Grace Everything" concept. Applies the Grace workout structure to running distances. Each round should take 3-4 minutes. Focus on negative splits within each round (getting faster with shorter distances).
