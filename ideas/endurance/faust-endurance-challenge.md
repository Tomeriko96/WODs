# Faust Endurance Challenge

**Equipment:** Running space or cardio machine, timer
**Time Cap:** 30-35 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce total time, use lower intensity intervals

**Workout:**
- 20-minute continuous effort at moderate pace (70-75% effort)
- Every 4 minutes: 30-second sprint (90% effort)
- No rest during sprint intervals - return immediately to moderate pace
- Cool down with 5-minute easy walk/jog

**Notes:**
Inspired by the Faust protocol. Tests mental fortitude with sustained effort interrupted by high-intensity bursts. The sprint intervals should feel like "selling your soul" for speed. Maintain rhythm and breathing between sprints.
