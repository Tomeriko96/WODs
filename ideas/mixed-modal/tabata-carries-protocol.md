# Tabata Carries Protocol

**Equipment:** Weights for carrying (kettlebells, dumbbells, sandbag)
**Time Cap:** 16 minutes
**Scaling:** Use lighter weights, substitute stationary holds

**Workout:**
- 4 x 4-minute Tabata rounds (20 sec work, 10 sec rest):
- Round 1: Farmers carry (20 sec walk, 10 sec rest) x 8
- Round 2: Front-loaded carry (20 sec walk, 10 sec rest) x 8
- Round 3: Overhead carry (20 sec walk, 10 sec rest) x 8  
- Round 4: Single-arm carry (switch arms each interval) x 8
- No rest between rounds

**Notes:**
Based on Mythical Strength's Tabata Carries. Constantly loaded for 16 minutes. Choose weights that allow continuous movement during work intervals. Mental toughness challenge.
