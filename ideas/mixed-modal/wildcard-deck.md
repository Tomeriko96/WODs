# Wildcard Deck

**Equipment:** Deck of cards, kettlebells, barbell (optional)
**Time Cap:** 20 minutes
**Scaling:** Use bodyweight movements, reduce total cards

**Workout:**
- Shuffle ace-10 of each suit
- Spades: squats
- Diamonds: push-ups
- Clubs: double kettlebell cleans (sets of 10)
- Hearts: overhead press
- Turn over cards, do that many reps (55 total per suit)

**Notes:**
You can use swings instead of cleans. Use a full deck for a longer challenge.
