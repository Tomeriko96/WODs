# Thruster Snatch Chaos

**Equipment:** Barbell, kettlebell
**Time Cap:** 15-20 minutes  
**Scaling:** Reduce weight, substitute movements, reduce reps

**Workout:**
Choose one of these protocols:
- 21-15-9: Barbell thrusters + KB snatches (per side)
- EMOM 20: Alternate between 5 thrusters and 10 KB snatches
- 10x5, 5x3, 5x1 for time (equal reps per side on snatches)
- Tabata intervals: 20s thrusters, 10s rest, 20s snatches, 10s rest

**Notes:**
Magical pairing - thrusters (knee dominant) and snatches (hip dominant) complement each other perfectly. Both get weight overhead but train different movement patterns. Heart rate will explode.
