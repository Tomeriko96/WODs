# Tower of Babel Redux

**Equipment:** Barbell, none
**Time Cap:** 25-35 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce top set, use lighter weight, substitute back squats

**Workout:**
- Front squat pyramid: 1-2-3-4-5-6... up to max reps, then back down
- Between every set: 5 burpees
- Work up until you can't add another rep
- Then work back down set by set: (max-1), (max-2), etc. until 1
- Pride will be punished on the way back down

**Notes:**
Named after the biblical tower. Your ambition on the way up determines your suffering on the way down. Use a weight you can typically do for 12-16 reps for best results. Expect to hit 6-10 reps as your top set.
