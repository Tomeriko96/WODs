# ROM Progression Circuit

**Equipment:** Barbell, plates, boxes/blocks for height adjustment
**Time Cap:** 20-25 minutes
**Scaling:** Use lighter weight, fewer height adjustments, bodyweight alternative

**Workout:**
- 5 rounds with increasing range of motion:
- Round 1: Deadlifts from 4-inch height + 200m run
- Round 2: Deadlifts from 2-inch height + 200m run  
- Round 3: Deadlifts from floor + 200m run
- Round 4: Deficit deadlifts 2-inch + 200m run
- Round 5: Deficit deadlifts 4-inch + 200m run
- 8 reps deadlifts each round, rest 2 min between rounds

**Notes:**
Based on Mythical Strength's ROM Progression concept. Progressive range of motion challenges different strength curves. Same weight throughout - choose conservatively for deficit rounds.
