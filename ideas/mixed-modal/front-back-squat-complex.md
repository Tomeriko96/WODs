# Front Back Squat Complex

**Equipment:** Barbell, plates, squat rack
**Time Cap:** 25-30 minutes
**Scaling:** Reduce weight, scale reps, substitute goblet squats

**Workout:**
- 8 rounds of:
  - 5 front squats (moderate weight)
  - Immediately into 5 back squats (same weight)
  - 10 burpees
  - 200m run
- Rest 90 seconds between rounds

**Notes:**
Inspired by Mythical Strength's Front/Back Squat Superset concept. The position change from front to back squat without re-racking creates unique challenge. Choose weight that allows both movements unbroken initially.
