# 7-Day Program - Day 5: Squat Tuesday

**Equipment:** Barbell, dumbbells, parallette bars or boxes, medicine ball
**Time Cap:** 60 minutes total
**Scaling:** Reduce squat depth, use lighter weights, modify gymnastics movements

**Workout:**

**Strength Portion (30 minutes):**
- Warm-up: 10 minutes squat prep and ankle mobility
- Front Squat: Work up to 5RM, then 4 x 3 at 90%
- Bulgarian Split Squats: 3 x 8 each leg (DB held at sides)
- Step-Ups: 3 x 10 each leg (24"/20" box)
- Single-Leg Calf Raises: 3 x 15 each leg

**WOD Portion (20 minutes):**
21-15-9 for time:
- Push-ups (any variation)
- Front Squats (moderate weight - 95/65 lbs)
- Toes-to-Bar (or Knee Raises)

**Cool-down (10 minutes):**
- Quad and hip flexor stretching

**Notes:** 
Front squat emphasis challenges core stability and upper back strength. Single-leg work addresses imbalances. WOD combines bodyweight skills with front squats to maintain leg-focused training. Front squats keep the load in front, requiring core strength without overhead movement.
