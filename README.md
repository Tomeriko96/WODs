# WOD Ideas Repository & üèãÔ∏è WOD Browser App


A simple, well-organized collection of **Workout of the Day (WOD) ideas** for fitness enthusiasts, trainers, and athletes. Now featuring a modern **Streamlit web app** for browsing, searching, and filtering workouts! This repository is strictly for storing and sharing workout ideas, not for logging completed workouts or tracking personal fitness history.

### Modern Appearance & UX

- **Readable Workout Steps:** Exercises are formatted as bulleted or numbered lists for easy scanning.
- **Filter Chips:** Active filters are shown as colored chips for clarity. Filters are grouped and more compact, with a prominent "Clear All Filters" button.
- **Consistent Color Palette:** The app uses a cohesive, modern color scheme for backgrounds, highlights, and buttons.
- **Improved Typography:** Larger, bolder titles and section headers, with clear font hierarchy for metadata and body text.
- **Better Spacing:** Increased padding and whitespace between cards, filters, and sections for a clean, breathable layout.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to mobile and desktop screens, with a flexible card grid.
- **Visual Accents:** Icons and accent backgrounds highlight key info (category, equipment, time cap, scaling, notes).
- **Polished Buttons:** Primary actions (like "Random Workout") are styled with accent colors and rounded corners.
